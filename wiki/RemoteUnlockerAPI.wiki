= API Introduction =

Once the PHP backend has been installed on the web hosting service and the Android library has been properly imported into the Eclipse workspace (see [RemoteUnlocker] Guide for details) is missing very little to use the functionality that the library provides.

=== Setup your project ===

With the library already present in the workspace, here's what you need to do to import it into your project:
  # enter in your project's properties: you can right click and select _Properties_, or you can press _Alt + Enter_ or you can select _Properties_ from the _Project menu_
  # in the properties menu on the right, select _Android_
  # In the bottom right (Library Section) click on the _Add..._ button
  # select _RemoteUnlocker_ and click _Ok_
  # Click _Apply_ then _OK_ to apply the change and close the Properties window

==== Edit {{{AndroidManifest.xml}}} ====

Now that the library has been successfully imported into your project you must add some _Permissions_ to the _*{{{AndroidManifest.xml}}}*_.

Here are the permissions to set:

 * android.permission._*{{{READ_PHONE_STATE}}}*_
 * android.permission._*INTERNET*_

== {{{RemoteUnlockerDialog}}} Class and the {{{Unlockable}}} Interface ==
