# Welcome to RemoteUnlocker project space! #

> Ok, you've created the _Android killer app for excellence_... I am so happy for you! :) You want to publish two versions in the _Android Market_: a free one, with some functions disabled or reduced, and a paid one with all features unlocked.

> Someone might say: "But I used the new _Google In-App Billing_ system!" - Great! Surely you are wonderful programmers... By the way, I have not yet figured out how that in-app-stuff works! :P

> But we continue because we still did not come to the problem surface. We were left to our two versions ... Entering the specific, speaking from programmer to programmer, surely the two versions differ slightly, maybe just a few lines of code, a _clickListener_, a check on an _array size_, a particular _integer value_ from the _`SharedPreferences`_ (and so on...): it is useless to try to convince the others (and yourself) that you actually implemented a mega-super-kEwL method that prevents the cracking of your beloved app! Hehe!

> But what does this mean? Now I will explain why I wanted to write this library. My case is quite simple, and perhaps quite common ...

> I have written an application that I published in the market in two versions: a free and a paid version. My boss at work wanted to use the full version, of course, without spending a dime! That damn bastard is still my boss ... Then I thought: I send him the _signed apk_ of the PRO version (by _email_ or whatelse).

> This could be a solution, but then I would have _**to give to him the apk file on each update**_... And maybe someone could rub in his e-mail account! So goodbye to millions of euros selling my PRO version! :(

> And so was born the idea of RemoteUnlocker! Since my PRO application differed only a few lines of code from the free version, I created a way to "transform" the free version into the PRO version!

> And all this with a simple Dialog where you enter an ordinary alphanumeric code!

> But this is certainly not the only reason to use RemoteUnlocker.

> RemoteUnlocker can be used to:

  * give your application as **GIFT** to friends and relatives (and bastard bosses too lol)
  * make your application as **PRIZE** for _contests & Co_
  * deploy your application to beta testers via the official channels (_Android Market_)
  * sell your application outside of _Google Checkout_ (see _Paypal_ and so on)

> So it will no longer need to spread your apk around the world at risk of losing control over distribution or - worse - let your hard work be stolen.

> In the Market will still be a FREE version that can become FULL at need (and still under your control). What more could you want? ;)

**RemoteUnlocker** is a tool for Android developers who want to implement a _**serial-code control system**_ in their applications in an easy and intuitive way.

> The tool consists of an _**Android library**_ (to be imported into your own projects) and a _**PHP + MySQL backend**_ (to add/edit/delete serials into the database)

> Let's start implementing this useful tool! Begin with RemoteUnlocker `StartUp Guide` to download and setup the tool or go to the [RemoteUnlockerAPI](RemoteUnlockerAPI.md) Developer's Guide!
